**User:** What can you tell me about the pdf I just uploaded?

**Oliver:** I can see you uploaded a PDF called **HSS26062-RURALCHHUB_rfp.pdf** — it looks like it's an RFP (Request for Proposal) related to something called "Rural Community Hub" based on the filename.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to extract the text content from inside the PDF. This sometimes happens with certain PDF formats, especially if they're scanned documents, image-based, or have special encoding.

Could you give me a quick summary of what's in the RFP? I'd love to help you work through it — whether that's understanding the requirements, brainstorming ideas for a response, or even building a prototype based on what they're asking for!
